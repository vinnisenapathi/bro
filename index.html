        <dt><u>ABOUT ESSENTIAL THING:</u></dt>
        <dd>Lokesh Senapathi who is my brother. Before saying why i affirmed him as my inspiration, Let me give you all the clear information why we have to choose and whom to choose as an inspiration.
        According to me inspiration is the most essential part as the water,food and shelter essential resources of our life.
    Choosing a person who is successfull which we didn't see his struggles is not that much better than choosing the person who actually supports you for everything and corrects in the private.
    Seeing someone who struggles to make their family proud, take care of them and support/guide his/her people to get more better in thier life.Make his/her people not to struggle as much as him/her struggled in thier life.
    So, rather than our family members there will be no other better inspiration to choose from other.Father the one who supports us in every sutituation no matter the opposition is strong,Mother , the only lady who cares us and feeds us.
    Eventhough there are many struggles they never show us but they always keep smile on their face. Siblings are the ones who look after us after our parents. At some extent parents might not be reacheable thier children in addition to siblings will take care of us.
    Here, Siblings are also our second parent who takes the complete responsibilities after parents.

            He came across a lot of struggles ahead to get success in his life. Right from my childhood he is the only one boy who stayed by my side after my father. He is the only person who believed me and giving me the guidence to secure a complete carrer.He struggled alot in his childhood. From class 5th he went stayed far from us eventhough he didn't like.
            He faced alot of problems in his school but never complained, he continued his schooling to get pass and see the smile in my parents face. As he studied in government school he secured about 90% in his intermediate.Noone came to guide or support him in his childhood he himself self motivated. Without anu guidence, he choosed his higher studies and again went far from us. He completed his graduation without a backlog of his four years.
            He choosed an branch which has less opportunities in our country but eventhpough he never stop his path to his success. He himself without any guidence learnt maximum courses which are perfect for the software. He had many sleepless nights and worked very hard. He never showed any rudness towards me eventhough i studied in private school instead he gave me the support which he didn't recieved from anyone and even today he is guiding me to achieve my goals and be in a better position.
            Who said people are selfish, I will show my brother with the softheart, polite, good mannered brother and a great son. Seeing my brothers strugglings and responsibilites which made me to inspire to choose an inspiration. So, I choosed my brother as my inspiration.
